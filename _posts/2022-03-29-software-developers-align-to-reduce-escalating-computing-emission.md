For those not intimately involved in software development, it’s hard to grasp just how much greenhouse gas is emitted when software is built, AI models are trained, and data centers are cooled — or to grasp that these emissions are increasing at an astronomical, climate-wrecking rate.

As part of our commitment to dramatically reduce the software development industry’s environmental impact, BCG X has joined the [Green Software Foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation/).

The foundation’s goal is to build a trusted ecosystem of people, standards, tooling, and best practices to make our industry more sustainable.
